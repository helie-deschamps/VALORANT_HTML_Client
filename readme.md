## Hi, I tried to code the VALORANT client homepage in pure HTML/CSS without JS
<img src="assets/headervr.png" alt="Banner of VALORANT">
<b><a href="https://playvalorant.com">VALORANT</a></b> is a first-person shooter game developed by Riot Games.<br>
In this project I tried to reproduce the client's home page in HTML and CSS as faithfully as possible with these interactions and animations but without using JavaScript.<br>
You can see the website in action at https://helie-deschamps.github.io/VALORANT_HTML_Client/<br>
